# location-based-ar-tutorial
Starting to play with interwebs and AR.

Using the AR.js tutorial found at: https://medium.com/chialab-open-source/build-your-location-based-augmented-reality-web-app-c2442e716564

This static location AR app is built entirely with HTML. The latitude and longitude coordinates are set to a location near me, and the deployment will only work with a camera mobile device (eg- your phone).  

I have used the tutorial Pokemon model and launched him in AR to float in the room. 

To experience this app for yourself: 
* Copy the code and enter in your own location coordinates
* Deploy 
* Navigate to the deployment with your phone
* Change phone privacy settings to allow location tracking and camera access
